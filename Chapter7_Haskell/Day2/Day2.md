Find:

* Functions that you can use on lists, strings, or tuples
    * 
* A way to sort lists
    * 

Do:

* Write a sort that takes a list and returns a sorted list.
* Write a sort that takes a list and a function that compares its two arguments and then returns a sorted list.
* Write a Haskell function to convert a string to a number. The string should be in the form of $2,345,678.99 and can possibly have leading zeros.
* Write a function that takes an argument x and returns a lazy sequence that has every third number, starting with x. Then, write a function that includes every fifth number, beginning with y. Combine these functions through composition to return every eighth number, begininning with x + y.
* Use a partially applied function to define a function that will return half of a number and another that will append \n to the end of any string.
